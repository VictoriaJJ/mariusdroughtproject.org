_title: Algal blooms in reservoirs
---

## Key science outputs

* Reservoir chlorophyll concentration
* Reservoir Cyanobacteria concentration

## Introduction

Algal blooms in reservoirs are a potentially serious problem for water quality.  Certain types, such as cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”), have the potential to produce harmful toxins.

## Research methods

An algal community model (PROTECH) was applied to simulate the algae of a reservoir under numerous scenarios.  The occurrence of blooms and cyanobacteria abundance was quantified.

## Result 1

Predicting the total chlorophyll concentration in reservoir over a range of Thames River flows and reservoir surface water temperatures over the period of June-September (the main growing season).

## Result 2: 	

Predicting the proportion of cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”) in reservoir over a range of Thames River flows and reservoir surface water temperatures over the period of June-September (the main growing season).
